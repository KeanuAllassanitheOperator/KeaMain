Desktopanwendung Oauth Google braucht kein Callback
For a console application where you can't use a local redirect server, you need to use the run_console() method. This approach works differently:

It will generate a URL for you to copy and paste into your browser
You'll authenticate in the browser
Google will show you an authorization code
You'll copy that authorization code and paste it back into your console

Important Google Cloud Console Settings
For this to work, you need to configure your OAuth client correctly in Google Cloud Console:

Go to Google Cloud Console -> APIs & Services -> Credentials
Edit your OAuth client ID
Make sure the application type is set to "Desktop app" (not Web application)
You shouldn't need to specify a redirect URI for desktop applications using console flow

Using the Script
When you run the updated script:

It will print a URL to the console
Copy and paste that URL into your browser
Complete the authentication flow in your browser
Google will show you an authorization code
Copy that authorization code
Paste it back into your console when prompt
